1. What is the problem you want to solve?

To predict whether a person is a good or bad candidate for a loan, and secondarily what the appropriate interest rate is for the person should they be granted a loan.


2. Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?

The client is a bank who wants to predict whether a potential customer should be a good or bad loan candidate, and secondarily what the appropriate interest rate should be offered to the client in either case.
