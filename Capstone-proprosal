1. What is the problem you want to solve?

To predict whether a person is a good or bad candidate for a loan, and secondarily an appropriate interest rate 
for the person given their likelihood of default.


2. Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?

The client is a bank who requires a model that will 

a) predict whether a potential customer is a good or bad loan candidate based on attributes such as employment length, whether they own a home, what their annual income is, what purpose is the loan, what state they
live in, etc. This will require the identification of a threshold beyond which the customer transitions to a bad loan candidate.

b) determine the appropriate interest rate that should be offered to the client based on their likelihood to repay the loan (or not, 
as the case may be).


3. What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?

https://github.com/h2oai/app-consumer-loan/tree/master/data/loan.csv

loan.csv contains 163,987 rows. The following data exists for each observation: 

loan_amnt
term
int_rate
emp_length
home_ownership
annual_inc
purpose
addr_state
dti
delinq_2yrs
revol_util
total_acc
bad_loan
longest_credit_length
verification_status

In summary, each row captures information about a consumer and the column "bad_loan" captures if the consumer
was either a good or bad loan. 

The original data can be downloaded at <https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action> and it is 
all the data from 2007 to June 30, 2015.  This does not incorporate the declined loan data set which does 
not have the same feature set.  


4. In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).

The first step will be to build a model that predicts whether a customer should be approved or denied a loan (e.g. Yes/No or 1/0) 
based on the historical data provided in the loan.csv data set.

To accomplish this the data set will be divided into a training set and a testing set. Models shall be developed and tested 
that that provide the best fit and minimize Type 1 and Type 2 error.


5. What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.
